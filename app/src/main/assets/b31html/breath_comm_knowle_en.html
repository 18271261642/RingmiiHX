<h3 class = "div_class_text1"> Medical examination explanation </h3>

<p class = "div_class_text">
    More than 30 apneas (without breathing, lasting 10s or more) during 7 consecutive hours of sleep, or an average of low ventilation (respiratory airflow reduction or complete cessation) more than 5 times per hour, can be considered to have sleep apnea Syndrome. If there is no improvement for a long time, please seek medical treatment promptly, conduct a comprehensive examination and take treatment. </p>


<h3 class = "div_class_text1"> Typical conditions </h3>

<div class = "div_class_text"> <p style = "margin: 10px"> (1) clinical manifestations during the day:
    ① lethargy;
    ② Dizziness and weakness;
    ③ abnormal mental state;
    ④ headache;
    ⑤ Irritability, irritability, anxiety, etc .;
    ⑥Sexual dysfunction. <br>
    (2) Clinical manifestations at night: <br>
    ① Snoring: snoring is irregular, snoring-airflow stop-panting-snoring alternately; ② apnea: terminates with wheezing, awakening or loud snoring.
    ③ Awake: often accompanied by turning over, involuntary movements of the limbs or even convulsions or suddenly starting, feeling palpitation, chest tightness or discomfort in the anterior region of the heart; ④ restlessness: turning at night, turning more frequently; ⑤ sweating, increased nocturia; ⑥ Abnormal sleep behavior: manifested as fear, exclamation, slang, night travel, auditory auditory, etc. <br> In addition, body fat, turbinate hypertrophy, snoring, etc. can also easily cause apnea syndrome. </p> </p> </div>


<h3 class = "div_class_text1"> Common knowledge about apnea syndrome </h3>
<p class = "div_class_text"> 1. Is sleep apnea syndrome harmful? </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> Answer: Sleep apnea syndrome is a chronic disease that is difficult to detect when it develops. Early symptoms are not easy to pay attention to. Once breathing is not smooth, it can cause snoring, and in the worst, it can cause hypoxia in the lungs and decrease blood oxygen. , Resulting in the body can not rest and recover, mental and physical conditions are poor, and the quality of life is significantly reduced. What's more serious is that when apnea occurs, the lack of external stimuli makes it difficult for patients to wake up, and they suddenly wake up until the organs are deprived of oxygen or even damaged, and the patients often don't care. For a long time, the cumulative damage will eventually cause all kinds of heart Cerebrovascular disease and mental illness, and even sudden death. </p>


<p class = "div_class_text"> 2, how is this disease caused? </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> Answer: Most are caused by airway obstruction. Including turbinate hypertrophy, tonsil hypertrophy, short jaw, thick neck circumference, and general obesity. Therefore, most of the sleep apnea syndrome is obstructive, and part of it is caused by the damage of the respiratory central nerve and respiratory regulation dysfunction, which is called central, or a mixture of both.

<p class = "div_class_text"> 3, how do I know if I am a patient with sleep apnea syndrome? </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> Answer: Simple judgment can be made based on whether it has typical clinical symptoms and signs, but due to the characteristics of its chronic disease and lack of monitoring equipment, it is difficult for patients to feel their nocturnal symptoms during sleep. Family descriptions and self-perception are easily misjudged and lack scientific evidence. Only when the condition is serious does the patient realize that he needs to go to the hospital for a diagnosis. The standard method is polysomnography (PSG). By taking blood oxygen monitoring as the core and cooperating with multiple physiological parameters such as electrocardiogram, electroencephalogram, myoelectricity, and electrooculogram, the type and extent of the disease can be accurately understood. At this time, the condition has often entered a more serious stage, the difficulty and cost of treatment and the patient's discomfort have increased significantly, so the earlier the diagnosis is better. </p>

<p class = "div_class_text"> 4, how to treat sleep apnea syndrome? </p>
<p class = "div_class_text">
    A: Currently there are few studies on central sleep apnea syndrome. Except for active treatment of conditions that cause respiratory regulation dysfunction (primary disease), there is still no effective treatment, but central sleep apnea syndrome often does not Will exist alone, so the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome also has a certain effect. The treatment of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome usually requires a treatment option based on the severity of the disease. No matter which method is used to treat apnea syndrome, there are only two ways. One is through the detection mechanism. When apnea occurs, it is interrupted by external stimuli. For example, when apnea is accompanied by severe hypoxia, it is Shock or push to reduce the duration of apnea, reduce or avoid damage to body organs; the second is no detection mechanism, and maintain the treatment state to avoid the occurrence of apnea.

<p class = "div_class_text"> 5. What is the use of blood oxygen monitoring for sleep apnea syndrome? </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> For patients with sleep apnea syndrome, blood oxygen monitoring has the following advantages: </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> (1) When the snoring develops into an apnea phase, early warning indicates the risk of disease. </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> (2) In the early stage of the disease, as a basis for diagnosis, seek medical treatment early, reduce the difficulty of treatment, reduce the cost of treatment, and increase the chance of cure. </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> (3) In the treatment stage, timely monitor the condition at night and feedback the treatment effect. </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> (4) It can be used as an important basis for detecting apnea, and it can be used to monitor the disease with wake-up means. </p>
