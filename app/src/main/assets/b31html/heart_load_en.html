<h3 class = "div_class_text1"> Medical examination explanation </h3>
<p class = "div_class_text"> The normal heart load value is 20pi-40pi, and the average or highest value exceeds this interval, all belong to heart overload: significant
    An upward red arrow appears after the value is displayed. If the heart is overloaded for a long period of time, it is recommended to seek medical treatment promptly and conduct a comprehensive examination to avoid heart danger.
    Dangerous situations. </p>
<h3 class = "div_class_text1"> Noun explanation </h3>
<p class = "div_class_text"> Heart load refers to the blood flow perfusion index, which reflects the pulsating blood flow. </p>

<h3 class = "div_class_text1"> Typical conditions </h3>
<p class = "div_class_text"> A larger pi value, higher heart rate and blood pressure, shortness of breath, and often fatigue. </p>

<h3 class = "div_class_text1"> Treatment methods </h3>
<p class = "div_class_text"> Ensure adequate rest, do not overwork and stay up late, relax your mind, avoid stress, and eat less greasy food. If there is no improvement, it is recommended to seek medical treatment in time and conduct a comprehensive medical examination, and cannot be taken lightly. </p>

<h3 class = "div_class_text1"> Heart load common sense </h3>
<p class = "div_class_text"> Heart load is divided into:

<p class = "div_class_text"> (1) precardiac load; (2) postcardiac load. Cardiac preload, also known as volumetric load, refers to the load encountered before myocardial contraction, which is actually a response to end-diastolic volume or end-diastolic wall tension. Afterload refers to the resistance or load encountered after myocardial contraction, also known as pressure load. Aortic and pulmonary arterial pressures are the afterload of the left and right ventricles. </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> 1. Preload of the heart </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> Increased preload of the heart, main factors, and possible heart problems: </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> (1) Valve disease, such as mitral, tricuspid, and aortic insufficiency, can increase the capacity load, and mitral and tricuspid stenosis can reduce the capacity load. </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> (2) Internal and external shunt diseases, such as: atrial septum, ventricular septal defect, and open arterial duct can increase the volume load. </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> (3) Systemic blood volume changes, such as input of a large amount of fluid, hyperthyroidism, chronic anemia, etc. in a short period of time can increase the volume load.
    Sweating, diarrhea, blood loss, etc., lead to a decrease in effective circulating blood volume, which can reduce preload. Left ventricle is common in aorta, mitral insufficiency, and congenital heart disease with right-to-left or left-to-right shunt; right ventricle is common in atrial septal defect, pulmonary valve or tricuspid insufficiency, etc. Overburden: severe anemia, hyperthyroidism, beriberi heart disease and movement
    Pulse fistula and so on. </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> 2. Post-cardiac load </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> Increased post-cardiac load, main factors, and possible heart problems: </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> (1) Aortic compliance: The ability of the aorta to expand the wall of the vessel with increasing pressure. If the vessel wall thickens, the compliance decreases. </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> (2) Peripheral vascular resistance: It depends on the cross-sectional area of ​​the arterial vascular bed and the vascular tension, which is affected by vascular and humoral factors. </p>
<p class = "div_class_text"> (3) Blood viscosity: As blood viscosity increases, peripheral vascular resistance increases. </p>
<p class = "div_class_text">
    (4) Circulating blood volume. Among them, peripheral vascular resistance is the most important, and it is often used clinically as an indicator of left ventricular afterload. Left ventricular post-load is common in hypertension, obstruction of aortic outflow tract (aortic stenosis, aortic constriction); right ventricular post-load is common in pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary obstructive disease and pulmonary embolism. </p>
